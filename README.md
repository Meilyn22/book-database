# Overview

This program helped me to learn sqlalchemy and the python terminal. SQLAlchemy is great with flask to create web applications.

This is a book database made with sqlAlchemy, flask and python. The program contains a csv file with names of books pre-installed. You can either hardcode the names of the books into the csv or add them with the program.

It's a crud application that add, delete, modify and read items in tables already pre-created.

1. Run the app.py file to start the program.
2. Choose what you wish to do and follow the prompt.

I wrote this program because I wanted to learn sqlAlchemy. I plan on building an application that will serve as a job board for computer science and programming students. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

The database is made with sqlAlchemy.

The database contains 5 rows to save books.

1. id
2. title
3. author
4. published
5. price 

# Development Environment

To see the items required to run the software please check the requirements.txt file.

This program was made with Python 3.10.0

# Future Work

* I want to add html templates to this program instead of using the terminal.
* I feel like I could've used fewer code if I didn't clean user input. 
* I need to add more roles with more information about the books e.g summary.
